mkgae
   will run the shared buildout and make gae.local here

mkapp ~/fully/qualified/dir/to/projectname
   depends on existing gae.local here and will create per-app environments
   the real app dependencies will be managed by buildout and system python2.5
   but for convenience it's placed in a virtualenv accessible via:

workon projectname
